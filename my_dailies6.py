Question of the day for January 11th 2022


#Create a function func() which takes a variale number of arguments and prints out those variables.
#So for example if func(23, 25, 25)
#it should print 23, 25, and 25,
#if func(20, 21)
#it should print 20, 21

def func():
         #function prints variables and their arguments
         list = [20, 30, 40, 50]
         print(list)


#Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction.
#Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.

def my_function():
       print([3 + 4], [4-3])



#Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
#It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both.

def show_salary():
         #This function shows employees and their salaries
         employees = {"Richard":100, "Okere":100}
         print(employees)


#If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary
def show_salary():
         #This function shows employees and their salaries
         employees = {"Richard":100, "Okere":100}
         print(employees)

show_salary("Okere")
